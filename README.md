# Matrix GJ1 - Hamburglar Escape

This is a very simple game focused around the Atari 2600. The task was to create a video game with a modern gameplay loop that would easily run on an Atari 2600.

A team of four people worked together over a week for this game. It's an odd one. Likely one of the most frustrating pieces of coursework as we are basically told to not do anything we've learnt over the previous years and focus on the basics.

Basically it should be cast into the depths with no chance of resurfacing.
